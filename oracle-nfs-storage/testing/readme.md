# Testing Environment

Following the same layout as described in "Terraform Up and Running (2nd ed)" this is the root folder for a hypothetical "TEST" environment. The various components making this environment up are split into separate folders:

- bastion service
- database
- network

Apart from the Bastion Service the Terraform code is modularised.
