# Terraform Blogposts

Following my New Year's resolution I am now creating a repository for code related to my Terraform blogposts. I'll slowly start migrating the code I have pasted in my [Wordpress Blog](https://martincarstenbach.wordpress.com/) to this repository, with the intention of having a sub-directory per post.

Each sub-directory should come with its own readme (famous last words, I know) and instructions.

Please note that the same disclaimer I used for the blog applies here as well. In summary I have tried my best to ensure the code works, but as indicated in the [license](LICENSE) file can't take any responsibility if stuff breaks. I didn't check whether you need any software licenses to run the code, nor does this repository pay special attention to avoid incurring cost when creating cloud resources. 

> As with everything in the cloud, there is most likely cost associated. Don't run any of this unless you are sure you understand the implications, especially those around money!

As with all code publicly availble on the Internet, please don't use this repository unless you absolutely understand each line of code

*Happy Automating!*
